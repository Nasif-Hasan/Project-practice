            <p>Planning your meals ahead of time might help you avoid junk food. It is a skill that helps you choose,
                purchase, and prepare nutritious meals and snacks regularly. This may also increase the frequency of
                homemade foods in your daily diet. There are lesser chances of craving junk food when you plan and
                prepare your meals. </p>
