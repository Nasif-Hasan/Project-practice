            <p>My favorite salad, the easiest and simplest thing you've ever had. Israelis put it in any type of pita,
                and eat it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is the best. Very healthy, simple, and easy. </p><br>

            <h2>Taking fruit provides health benefits</h2>
            <p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have
                propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed
                dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of
                food. </p><br>
